Here I list the default configurations of the tests as in the configuration
files in savina/src/main/java/edu/rice/habanero/benchmarks.
Listing the numbers and the relevant part of the code.
Also, I am listing pertinent aspects of the BM in Akka vs Encore

1.pingpong
2 actors only
-- input values same, structure almost same

PingPongConfig.java
40 000 messages
and in input.txt
40000
> protected static int N = 40000;
> ...
> System.out.printf(BenchmarkRunner.argOutputFormat, "N (num pings)", N);
* No extra test output in Akka or Encore

* Akka sends an exit and a StopMessage, and Encore does not

2.ThreadRing
same configuration,
slight difference in structure.

* Configuration
ThreadRingConfig.java
100 actors
100_000 pings

and in Encore
100 100000

* Structure
slightly different structure, but due to the difference in languages,
ie Akka cannot send integers on messages.
Enc only stores one 'next' pointer in each actor, while Akka seems to create
an array of actors (line 32-37)  and then use it to populate the `next` pointer.
Also, in Akka, messages are objects, with functions `hasNext` and `next`
while in Encore they are plain integers.



3.Counting
(2 actors only: Counter and Producer, 1_000_000 messages,
and most messages do  not carry information )
CountingConfig.java
1_000_000 messages
and same in Encore

structure similar.

6.Fib (2^N actors to calculate fib(N-1) )
same configuration, samr structure (again, Akka messages carry numbers,
while Encore's messages are numbers)
* configuration
25 in Akka
25 in Enc

7.Chameneos
8.Big
9.concdict
11.BndBuffer
12.DiningPhilosophers
21.ParallelQuickSort
28.TrapezoidalApproximation
29.PiPrecision
